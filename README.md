Uses the BeautifulSoup package and requests-HTML library to scrape Ids, prices, rating, number of ratings, and titles of user defined products on Amazon.com. Uses these metrics to determine which product is the best deal per page. User can also set how many pages they wish to include. At the end, the program determines which is the overall top product of all the best deals in each page, and uses pandas to export the data to a csv file.
